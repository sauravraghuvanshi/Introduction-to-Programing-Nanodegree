// The code checks the number of musicians in a group and prints a message based on the count.
// If there are 0 musicians, it prints "not a group".
// If there is 1 musician, it prints "solo".
// If there are 2 musicians, it prints "duet".
// If there are 3 musicians, it prints "trio".
// If there are 4 musicians, it prints "quartet".
// If there are more than 4 musicians, it prints "this is a large group".
// The code uses a series of if-else statements to check the number of musicians and print the corresponding message.
