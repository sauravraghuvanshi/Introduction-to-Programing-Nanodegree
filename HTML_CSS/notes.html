<h1>HTML Notes</h1>
<p>This page is a collection of my awesome notes about 
  HTML!</p>

  <h2>The Web</h2>
<p>The Web (or World Wide Web) is a collection of documents 
  and other files. Most of the documents are made using 
  Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).</p>

<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. 
It's used to define the structure or layout of a web page.</p> 

<h2>
    Text Editors and Files
</h2>

<p>
Each text editor has its own features like:<br>
<ul>
  <li> Syntax highlighting </li>
  <li>numbers </li>
</ul>

Make sure you're using a text editor and not a word 
processor. They can add information to files on how to 
format text where as a text editor edits plain text files.<br>

When writing HTML, make sure to use the extension .html 
on your file name. An example would be spiffy.html. <br>

You can open the file in the browser. <br>

If you want to see a change in the browser that was made 
in the HTML file, you need to save the HTML file and 
refresh the browser. <br>
</p>

<h2>
    Markup
</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Markup: Text that has a special meaning element starts 
  and ends with a tag.
  <!-- <em>Hi there!</em> -->
<li>  <em>Hi there!</em> <br>
<li>The first tag <em>is called an opening tag, 
    the one with a slash </em> is called a closing tag. <br>
<li> HTML tags always start with the < sign and end with 
  a > tag. These are usually referred to as angle brackets.<br>
</ul>

  </p>

<h2>
    Lots of Elements
</h2>

<p>
This is a <em>story</em> all about how <mark>my life</mark> 
got <sub>flipped</sub> turned <sup>upside down</sup>. <br>
</p>

<h2>
  Nesting
</h2>

<p>
HTML elements can't overlap, one must be inside the other.

<h1>My Chemistry Notes</h1>
<p>
    <strong>Molecule name:</strong> <em>Sulfur hexafluoride
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Molecular formula</strong>: SF<sub>6</sub>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> This gas has a much higher density 
    than air. Basically the opposite of helium. 
    <mark>Crazy!</mark>

This line should not be part of the list!
(But it will be, if you forget to put a closing tag!)
