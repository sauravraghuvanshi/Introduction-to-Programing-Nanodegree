// The code checks if the user has enough money to buy a hammer priced at $200.
// If the user has enough money, it prints "You can buy the hammer!".
// Otherwise, it prints "You can't buy the hammer!".
// The code uses a simple if-else statement to compare the money with the price.
// The code is straightforward and easy to understand.
